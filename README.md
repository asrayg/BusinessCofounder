## Cloud Tools
Our platform is powered by several AWS services to ensure scalability and performance:

1. **AWS Bedrock**: Provides AI-driven features for user matching and recommendations.
2. **AWS AppRunner**: Manages the backend services for user data and API handling.
3. **AWS Amplify**: Hosts the frontend, ensuring seamless integration with backend services and easy deployment.

## Frontend Engineering
The frontend for **BusinessCoFounder** was built with a focus on providing a smooth and intuitive user experience. Here's a breakdown of the frontend architecture:

### Tech Stack
- **React**: We used React for building the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **AWS Amplify**: Our frontend is hosted and deployed using AWS Amplify, allowing for easy management of the UI, integration with backend services, and automatic CI/CD pipelines.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, we used Tailwind CSS, which provides utility-first classes that help us design clean and responsive UIs with minimal custom CSS.
  
### Features
- **User Dashboard**: A clean and organized dashboard where users can view co-founder recommendations, edit their profiles, and manage collaboration requests.
- **Search and Match**: A dynamic search functionality, leveraging AI from AWS Bedrock, that matches users with potential co-founders or collaborators.
