Users can upload pictures of animals, and the platform will help diagnose potential health issues by connecting them with knowledgeable animal shelter volunteers and veterinarians. This platform bridges the gap between pet owners, volunteers, and veterinary professionals to provide timely care and support, ensuring lost pets are found and sick animals receive the attention they need*
